Paul Barry lives with his wife Deirdre in Carlow, Ireland, a small town located 80km from Dublin. Their three grown-up
children (Joseph, Aaron, and Aideen) have all recently “flown the coop.”

Paul works at the South East Technological University (SETU) and is based at the Kilkenny Road Campus, Carlow, where he
lectures as part of the academic Computing Department. Paul’s taught for a long time, and has been using Python with all
of his class groups for close to fifteen years.

Paul has an MSc and a BSc in Computing, and a post-grad qualification in Learning & Teaching. He never did get around to
doing a PhD, so no one should ever refer to him as “professor,” although he does get a kick out of that when they do.

Paul spent part of the ‘80s and ‘90s working in the IT industry, mainly within a healthcare setting in Canada. He’s also
written other books and—back in the day—was a contributing editor at Linux Journal magazine.

All of this (sadly) means Paul is getting on a bit. Please don’t tell anyone.
